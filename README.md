==================================
*<dl><dt> The site is live!!! Check it out [here](http://54.247.71.56:3000) </dt></dl>*
We are a team of three second year Computer Science students from the University of Manchester 
and we decided to develop a small website for displaying the famous tourist locations in any 
city around the world. 

The user types in the name of a city from the world and the website
displays the top 10 tourist locations from that city. As an additional feature it displays the 
most optimized path to reach all of them. This helps the tourist in saving time , money and effort
and plan his journey much better than just seeing the path to each and every place he wants to visit.
The user can also select from categories which classify places(tourist locations) according to 
interest like food/drink , beaches , heritage sites and much more. 

We developed the website by using Google APIs which are the most reliable on displaying maps
and satellite data. The shortest distance was calculated by the application of the classic 
Travelling Salesman problem.
